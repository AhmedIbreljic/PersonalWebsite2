	<h3>Blue Skies and Bright Stars: the SEB Story</h3>
	<p> <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org">Space Enterprise at Berkeley</a> is UC Berkeley's space-shot rocketry team, and personally, the highlight of my college experience. Founded by a group of ambitious students in 2016, two years before I began studying at Berkeley, SEB has always had the goal of being the first collegiate team to build and fly a liquid rocket past the 100-km Karman line and into what is officially considered outer space. In doing so, we'd be able to show the world that spaceflight is 	accessible, well within the reach of even a group of determined college students on a tight budget. Besides, why not shoot high? </p>

	<p> But, as the co-founders of SEB soon found out, starting out with a spaceshot wasn't the best idea. During my freshman fall, I got to take part in what I call SEB's "rebuild"; instead of jumping to a liquid-fueled spaceshot with minimal experience, we began to get our feet wet. Our first "low-altitude demonstrator", LAD-1, stood eight feet tall and just over six inches in diameter. Sporting an all-composite airframe entirely laid up by the team, LAD-1 launched on an experimental solid motor generously donated to the team by a mentor, reaching 6 000 feet and looking good doing so. </p>

	<p> However, recovery system deployment woes brought her down hard. The airframe (and our egos) sustained some minor damage, but we turned around quickly, building and flying LAD-2, a smaller four-inch-diameter rocket the next spring. LAD-2 was equipped with a redesigned parachute deployment system and was a testbed for more experimentation with composites. Among my favorite details on the rocket are the carbon fiber fillets holding the fins to the aft airframe, made using a wet slurry of chopped fiber mixed with epoxy resin. The LAD projects (including the never-flown LAD-3, which was a larger airframe made to interface with the LAD-2 nosecone setion) were my first hands-on introdution to the world of composites, and I quickly discovered the beauty of these materials.</p>

  <h3>LAD-4</h3>
  <p> As the team began to approach the design phase of our first liquid-fueled rocket, Eureka-1, we chose to build a fourth LAD airframe, LAD-4, that would be a testbed for the dual-deployment parachute system that the Eureka fleet would require. I volunteered to lead the project, and together we built and flew LAD-4 to a record-breaking height (11 193 ft) within the span of seven weeks - the fastest ground-up build time ever for SEB.</p>

	<p> Here are some of my favorite features of LAD-4:
	<ul>
		<li> A completely modular fin attachment system, a departure from previous designs. As part of the goal of flight reusability, modularity allows us to replace one or more damaged fins at a moment's notice.</li>
		<li> A robust thrust plate, featuring a wood-core composite structure that withstands the engine's thrust force, transferring it through to the airframe. The thrust plate also provides a hard point for motor retention after the burn is complete. </li>
		<li> Dual-deployment pyrotechnic recovery that functioned well in flight. The drogue parachute is deployed at apogee, while the main parachute is held in place by a carabiner system, released at the command of onboard avionics when the vehicle reaches a certain height above ground.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> After the flight, I led the team in putting together a complete technical report, which detailed the design, fabrication, testing, and first flight of LAD-4. Hopefully, this document will serve as a resource for future SEB members who will fly the airframe again, or borrow elements from its design on future LAD vehicles.

  <h3>What is SEB?</h3>
  <p> Good question! </p>
