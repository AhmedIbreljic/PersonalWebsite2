	<h3>Blue Skies and Bright Stars: the SEB Story</h3>
	<p> <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org">Space Enterprise at Berkeley</a> is UC Berkeley's space-shot rocketry team, and personally, the highlight of my college experience. Founded by a group of ambitious students in 2016, two years before I began studying at Berkeley, SEB has always had the goal of being the first collegiate team to build and fly a liquid rocket past the 100-km Karman line and into what is officially considered outer space. In doing so, we'd be able to show the world that spaceflight is 	accessible, well within the reach of even a group of determined college students on a tight budget. Besides, why not shoot high? </p>

	<p> But, as the co-founders of SEB soon found out, starting out with a spaceshot wasn't the best idea. During my freshman fall, I got to take part in SEB's "rebuild"; instead of jumping to a liquid-fueled spaceshot with minimal experience, we began to get our feet wet with smaller solid-fueled rockets. Our first "low-altitude demonstrator", LAD-1, stood eight feet tall and just over six inches in diameter. Its most distinguishing feature is an all-composite monocoque airframe, handmade by the team. We carefully laid up sheets of bidirectional carbon fiber and fiberglass fabric on a cardboard mandrel protected by a mylar sheath, applying layers of epoxy along the way. For the nosecone, we manufactured a wooden mold using a Shopbot CNC router, laying up on the inside of the mold, and attaching the two halves together. Finally, the whole airframe was meticulously sanded, finished, and painted for flight.</p>

	<p> In late Fall 2018, LAD-1 launched on an experimental solid motor generously donated to the team by a mentor, reaching 6 000 feet and looking good doing so. However, recovery system deployment woes brought her down hard. The airframe (and our egos) sustained some minor damage, but we turned around quickly, building and flying LAD-2, a smaller four-inch-diameter rocket the next spring. LAD-2 was equipped with a redesigned parachute deployment system and was a testbed for more experimentation with composites. Among my favorite details on the rocket are the carbon fiber fillets holding the fins to the aft airframe, made using a wet slurry of chopped fiber mixed with epoxy resin. The LAD projects (including the never-flown LAD-3, which was a larger airframe made to interface with the LAD-2 nosecone setion) were my first hands-on introdution to the world of composites, and I quickly discovered the beauty of these materials.</p>

  <h3>LAD-4</h3>
  <p> As the team began to approach the design phase of our first liquid-fueled rocket, Eureka-1, we chose to build a fourth LAD airframe, LAD-4, that would be a testbed for the dual-deployment parachute system that the Eureka fleet would require. I volunteered to lead the project, and together we built and flew LAD-4 to a record-breaking height (11 193 ft) within the span of seven weeks - the fastest ground-up build time ever for SEB. LAD-4 was primarily based on the composite-based design of predecessors and also featured a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer aerostructure. But we swapped in removable metal fins for the previous wood-core-composite design and redesigned the fin-mounting system; along with other parts of LAD-4, this was an intentional choice in the spirit of reusability: we intended the airframe to fly upwards of five times in order to rigorously validate the recovery system that would bring Eureka-1 home.</p>

	<p> Here are some of my favorite features of LAD-4:
	<ul>
		<li class="litwo"> A completely modular fin attachment system, a departure from previous designs. As part of the goal of flight reusability, modularity allows us to replace one or more damaged fins at a moment's notice.</li>
		<li class="litwo"> A robust thrust plate, featuring a wood-core composite structure that withstands the engine's thrust force, transferring it through to the airframe. The thrust plate also provides a hard point for motor retention after the burn is complete. </li>
		<li class="litwo"> Dual-deployment pyrotechnic recovery that functioned well in flight. The drogue parachute is deployed at apogee, while the main parachute is held in place by a carabiner system, released at the command of onboard avionics when the vehicle reaches a certain height above ground.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> After the flight, I led the team in putting together a complete technical report, which detailed the design, fabrication, testing, and first flight of LAD-4. (The two CAD screenshots above are from the report pages.) Hopefully, this document will serve as a resource for future SEB members who will fly the airframe again, or borrow elements from its design on future LAD vehicles.

  <h3>What is SEB?</h3>
  <p> Good question! </p>
