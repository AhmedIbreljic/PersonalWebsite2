	<h3>Space Enterprise at Berkeley: Our Story</h3>
	<p> <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org">SEB</a> is UC Berkeley's space-shot rocketry team, and personally, the highlight of my college experience. Founded by 
	a group of ambitious students in 2016, two years before I began studying at Berkeley, SEB has always had the goal of being the first collegiate team to build and fly
	a liquid rocket past the 100-km Karman line and into what is officially considered outer space. In doing so, we'd be able to show the world that spaceflight is 
	accessible, well within the reach of even a group of determined college students on a tight budget. Besides, why not shoot high?</p>

	<p> But, as the co-founders of SEB soon found out, starting out with a spaceshot wasn't the best idea. During my freshman fall, I got to take part in what I call SEB's "rebuild"; 
	instead of jumping to a liquid-fueled spaceshot with minimal experience, we began to get our feet wet. Our first "low-altitude demonstrator", LAD-1, stood eight feet tall and just over
	six inches in diameter. Built out of a carbon-fiber composite, LAD-1 launched on an experimental solid motor generously donated to the team by a mentor, reaching 6 000 feet and looking good doing so. However,
	recovery system deployment woes brought her down hard. The airframe (and our egos) sustained some minor damage, but we turned around quickly, building and flying LAD-2, a 
	smaller four-inch-diameter rocket the next spring.
