	<h3>The SEB Story</h3>
	<p> <a href="https://www.berkeleyse.org">Space Enterprise at Berkeley</a> is UC Berkeley's space-shot rocketry team, and personally, the highlight of my college experience. Founded by a group of ambitious students in 2016, two years before I began studying at Berkeley, SEB has always had the goal of being the first collegiate team to build and fly a liquid rocket past the 100-km Karman line and into what is officially considered outer space. In doing so, we'd be able to show the world that spaceflight is 	accessible, well within the reach of even a group of determined college students on a tight budget. Besides, why not shoot high? </p>

	<p> But, as the co-founders of SEB soon found out, starting out with a spaceshot wasn't the best idea. During my freshman fall, I got to take part in what I call SEB's "rebuild"; instead of jumping to a liquid-fueled spaceshot with minimal experience, we began to get our feet wet. Our first "low-altitude demonstrator", LAD-1, stood eight feet tall and just over six inches in diameter. Sporting an all-composite airframe entirely laid up by the team, LAD-1 launched on an experimental solid motor generously donated to the team by a mentor, reaching 6 000 feet and looking good doing so. </p>

<p> However, recovery system deployment woes brought her down hard. The airframe (and our egos) sustained some minor damage, but we turned around quickly, building and flying LAD-2, a smaller four-inch-diameter rocket the next spring. LAD-2 was equipped with a redesigned parachute deployment system and was a testbed for more experimentation with composites. Among my favorite details on the rocket are the carbon fiber fillets holding the fins to the aft airframe, made using a wet slurry of chopped fiber mixed with epoxy resin. The LAD projects (including the never-flown LAD-3, which was a larger airframe made to interface with the LAD-2 nosecone setion) were my first hands-on introdution to the world of composites, and I quickly discovered the beauty of these materials.</p>
