<p id="headerone" class="bottom-one">This page highlights some of the internship projects I’ve had the opportunity to work on. Please note that details, descriptions, and schematic figures are intentionally kept at a high level, pursuant to NDAs signed prior to employment. While I’d love to give more details, I would rather avoid the additional paperwork! </p>

<h3> Tesla, Palo Alto, CA (Summer 2021) </h3>
	<p> At Tesla, I had the chance to work on the high-voltage structural battery pack for the Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. This was a fast-paced, rewarding experience in which I interfaced with vendors and contract manufacturers across the world, while building my own testing fixtures and conducting coupon-level testing in-house. My work focused on material characterization within the context of mechanical design: how would bonded interfaces perform under nominal operation? How would the combination of materials and surface treatments affect the strength and stiffness of the battery pack?</p> 
	
<h3>Design and Validation of a Fluid Sealing Surface</h3>
<p>I oversaw the design and material selection for a fluid sealing surface designed to prevent the flow of liquid structural adhesive past its designed perimeter, where subsequent curing had the possibility to damage sensitive electrical components. First, I characterized several foam material candidates for their performance against leaks under the nominal pressure of the structural adhesive. I did this at minimal cost and within a 24-hour turnaround by designing an entirely 3D-printed test fixture. While our supplier proposed using a CNC mill to create a test fixture, a process which required several weeks of lead time and a high material cost, I was able to demonstrate the efficacy of several foam materials as a sealing surface within a few days. I did this by creating a to-scale model for the interface, replicating the contours of the mating parts where needed. Due to the rapid nature of 3D-printing, I was also able to take multiple measurements at multiple compression values using the same fixture by printing replaceable parts that worked with the same enclosure. Next, I characterized the compressive stress-strain behavior of various foams and empirically determined guidelines for minimum and maximum compression based on tolerance stackup considerations, resultant stresses on adjacent parts, and achievable dimensions given manufacturing constraints. By carefully articulating this design envelope to the CM, we were able to design a part which resulted in a 96% reduction in stress compared to an initial concept.  <br> </p>
	
<h3>Selection of Surface Treatment to Optimize Adhesive Bonding Strength</h3>
<p>After initial tests demonstrated that an uncoated-aluminum component had insufficient adhesion to a structural adhesive within the assembly, I took responsibility for determining a sufficient surface treatment to increase the bonding strength at this interface past the acceptable level, which had been determined by fatigue simulations. To decrease development time and cost, I sourced material samples from around the fabrication facility; doing this helped to avoid shipping costs and long lead times for test panels from suppliers located around the world.  <br> </p>
	
<p>Simultaneously, I designed an experiment to identify a suitable surface treatment across a variety of possibilities and characterize its performance in ambient conditions and after aging. My testing revealed a particular solution that proved effective and stable over the design lifetime of the part, eliminating the risk of adhesive delamination. This change immediately became the plan of record for the assembly, in time for upcoming large-scale validation trials which would not have passed otherwise.  <br> </p>

<h3> Formlabs, Somerville, MA (Fall 2020) </h3>
		<p> My experience at Formlabs was exciting, centered around the development of then-future products. I worked on the <a href="https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Form-Wash-L-and-Form-Cure-L?language=en_US"> Form Wash L </a>, a large-scale automated part-washing machine designed to interface with parts printed on the Form 3L. In addition to creating and editing part drawings for prototype production and building up machines for functional prototyping, I conducted a few experiments to characterize the performance of the Wash L based on tunable preset settings.</p> 
	
<h3>Wash Performance Characterization</h3>
<p>After an SLA print is finished and removed from the printer, a thin film of liquid resin coats the outside of the solidified, crosslinked part. This is a consequence of the “bottom-up” design of most commercial SLA printers; as each layer is printed, the region around the printed layer remains submerged in a vat of liquid resin. As such, it is necessary to clean this liquid resin off of part surfaces; traditionally, this is done using a combination of solvation (e.g. using alcohol to dissolve resin) and agitation (e.g. by swirling the part in a cleaning solution). <br> </p>
	
<p>During the prototyping stage of an automated washing solution for large-scale SLA printers, I designed an experiment to determine how “washed” a part was as a function of several tunable machine parameters (e.g. the length of washing). An important first step was to develop a repeatable way to quantify cleanliness, specific to the SLA printing process. I investigated several possibilities and determined a quantitative metric using an ASTM standard as inspiration. (Unfortunately, the details of my particular test method for resin-printed parts and the results of my testing cannot be reproduced here.) Using this metric, I conducted a screening experiment to isolate critical machine parameters from a wide array of potential options; by narrowing this list down, I was able to quantify correlations that would influence the default machine parameters.  <br> </p>
	
<h3>Design of an Activated Carbon Filtration System for Large-Scale 3D-Printer Exhaust</h3>
<p>Stereolithography (SLA) is an attractive form of 3D-printing, producing extremely accurate features and smooth surface finishes. A variety of liquid resins with widely different material properties can be printed for a large number of potential applications. However, a known hazard associated with SLA printing is the high volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the liquid resin, especially if it is heated to achieve a favorable viscosity for mixing and printing. <br> </p>
	
<p>In this project, I designed a large-scale prototype to validate the concept of an activated carbon exhaust filter. I built a “resin chamber” that included a closed-loop heater control system that kept the liquid resin at a constant set temperature, allowing the measurement of produced VOCs as a function of temperature. I also studied different filtration solutions, using various types of activated carbon within a fungible enclosure. By measuring the change in pressure, temperature, and VOC content across the filter, I was able to characterize the effectiveness of activated carbon at different particle sizes. <br> </p>



	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<h3>Custom Facial Orthotics for Burn and Injury Survivors</h3>
	<h4><a href="https://www.precisionpatientoutcomes.com/" target="_blank">Precision Patient Outcomes - Berkeley, CA</a></h4>
	<p>Treatment for facial injuries involving scarring and skin regrowth, especially due to burns, is tricky - every face is unique, and no two individuals share the same facial geometry. Precision Patient Outcomes is a startup in Berkeley that aims to address this problem by manufacturing custom orthotic face masks for those that need them to assist in the healing process. Each patient's face is scanned in 3D using a custom and secure application. The scan files are cleaned up, filled in where necessary, and processed for machining. After the manufacturing step is completed, the patient recieves a wearable device contoured to their exact facial features, which greatly promotes recovery of the skin in a timely manner. My role in this process was to take patient data "from scanned to CAM-ed", and prepare the mesh files in preparation for the specialized manufacturing process we use.</p>
	
<p> In addition to existing infrastructure, 3D printing is an excellent candidate for producing mask molds in high resolution, in a highly automated and regular process. Compared to milling and other subtractive processes, AM also produces minimal waste; the thermoplastic resins used with commerical FDM printers can also be recycled. We are currently exploring the feasibility of introducing SLA printers to the mold making process to further improve the resolution and surface finish of parts. </p>

	<h3>3D-Printed Vertical Wind Turbine</h3>
	<p>As the final project of a lower-division engineering course, a (small-scale) wind turbine was designed, simulated (Solidworks FEA), 3D printed (FDM), and tested for structure stiffness and power generation. Subject to weight, height, and print volume restrictions, the tower structure was designed to minimize deflection in a bending mode with an applied horizontal load. The turbine blade geometry was also optimized to maximize the output power with a constant wind source. Our tower structure was inspired by the bamboo plant, a naturally stiff structure. The round cross-section contributes to a high moment of inertia, allowing the "beam" to withstand a bending moment. </p>
	<p> The turbine generated 1.25 watts of power in testing, and the structure had a stiffness of 3.8N/mm. </p>

	<h3>PET Squeeze Bottle Prototyping</h3>
	<p>I am working with a small business in the food industry looking to develop a PET squeeze bottle for one of their products. A critical part of the development process is to iterate over bottle geometries, including bend radii and neck sizes. Using FDM printing, I am able to fabricate test articles quickly, to provide physical prototypes of each bottle shape. This is a low-cost, fast way to determine the "feel" of each bottle, which informs any subsequent design choices. This simple application of 3D printing highlights the capability of the manufacturing technology to quickly produce high quality parts, and the easy turnaround between CAD model and physical specimen. </p>
