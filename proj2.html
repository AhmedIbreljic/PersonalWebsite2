	<h3>Custom Facial Orthotics for Burn and Injury Survivors</h3>
	<h4><a href="https://www.precisionpatientoutcomes.com/" target="_blank">Precision Patient Outcomes - Berkeley, CA</a></h4>
	<p>Treatment for facial injuries involving scarring and skin regrowth, especially due to burns, is tricky - every face is unique, and no two individuals share the same facial geometry. Precision Patient Outcomes is a startup in Berkeley that aims to address this problem by manufacturing custom orthotic face masks for those that need them to assist in the healing process. Each patient's face is scanned in 3D using a custom and secure application. The scan files are cleaned up, filled in where necessary, and processed for machining. After the manufacturing step is completed, the patient recieves a wearable device contoured to their exact facial features, which greatly promotes recovery of the skin in a timely manner. My role in this process was to take patient data "from scanned to CAM-ed", and prepare the mesh files in preparation for the specialized manufacturing process we use.</p>
	
<p> In addition to existing infrastructure, 3D printing is an excellent candidate for producing mask molds in high resolution, in a highly automated and regular process. Compared to milling and other subtractive processes, AM also produces minimal waste; the thermoplastic resins used with commerical FDM printers can also be recycled. We are currently exploring the feasibility of introducing SLA printers to the mold making process to further improve the resolution and surface finish of parts. </p>

	<h3>3D-Printed Vertical Wind Turbine</h3>
	<p>As the final project of a lower-division engineering course, a (small-scale) wind turbine was designed, simulated (Solidworks FEA), 3D printed (FDM), and tested for structure stiffness and power generation. Subject to weight, height, and print volume restrictions, the tower structure was designed to minimize deflection in a bending mode with an applied horizontal load. The turbine blade geometry was also optimized to maximize the output power with a constant wind source. Our tower structure was inspired by the bamboo plant, a naturally stiff structure. The round cross-section contributes to a high moment of inertia, allowing the "beam" to withstand a bending moment. </p>
	<p> The turbine generated 1.25 watts of power in testing, and the structure had a stiffness of 3.8N/mm. </p>

	<h3>PET Squeeze Bottle Prototyping</h3>
	<p>I am working with a small business in the food industry looking to develop a PET squeeze bottle for one of their products. A critical part of the development process is to iterate over bottle geometries, including bend radii and neck sizes. Using FDM printing, I am able to fabricate test articles quickly, to provide physical prototypes of each bottle shape. This is a low-cost, fast way to determine the "feel" of each bottle, which informs any subsequent design choices. This simple application of 3D printing highlights the capability of the manufacturing technology to quickly produce high quality parts, and the easy turnaround between CAD model and physical specimen. </p>
