	<p id="headerone"> Here is a collection of projects that I've had the opportunity to work on during my time at UC Berkeley. Through these projects, I have found an appreciation for the intersection between 3D printing and composite materials; I believe that these two areas are representative of the current paradigm of engineering materials. Although I am investigating my passion at only a small scale, one drop in the bucket of the composites research that is being done across the world, I hope that my work will one day be part of the backdrop of engineering innovation. Besides the projects on this page, my work with <a href="/seb.html"> Space Enterprise at Berkeley </a> has given me a different appreciation for composites in the "real world". I am especially grateful to Professor Lin and Professor Gu in the ME Department, as well as Jacqueline Elwood, my research supervisor, for giving me the opportunity to pursue this research.</p>
	
	<h3>3D Printing of Laminar CFRP Composites</h3>
	<h4>Professor Grace Gu, UC Berkeley Department of Mechanical Engineering</h4>
	<p>Composite materials present an attractive solution to the problem of material selection for many applications. In particular, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are known for their high strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios, which make them excellent structural materials. CFRP composites are used in a wide variety of industries; you'll see them in automobiles, boats, golf clubs, skateboards, and rockets. A recent development in the composites industry is the advent of additive manufacturing (AM) methods that can automate the fiber placement process. Compared to "traditional" methods like wet layups and compression molding, which often requires the use of an autoclave. Years of development of these "traditional" manufacturing methods have yielded well-known techniques that produce excellent finished products. But AM presents an attractive alternative, greatly reducing "hands-on" time needed with parts, realizing complicated geometries, and allowing for a high degree of repeatability. The question remains, however, of how the material properties of parts using new AM technologies compares with those of parts made using more "traditional" methods like a wet layup. (To make FDM printing of continuous fibers possible, 3D printers often combine the fibers with a thermoplastic material that provides printability at the expense of strength and stiffness.)</p>
	<p> My research seeks to answer this question by directly comparing the material properties of a 3D-printed composite sample with a hand laid-up composite specimen (normalized to an equal fiber volume fraction). In addition to preliminary computations using equations developed in the literature, we are using a twofold approach to sample comparison. Both the printed and handmade samples will be simulated in tension, compression, and flexure using ANSYS, and then the physical specimens will undergo mechanical testing (following ASTM standards). The results of this study will hopefully provide a fair point of comparision between the two methods as well as perspective on the viability of new AM technology for industrial applications.</p>
	
  
	<h3>Development of a Conductive Nanomaterial for SLA Printing</h3>
	<h4>Professor Liwei Lin, UC Berkeley Department of Mechanical Engineering</h4>
	<p>Additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA) is a promising way of obtaining rapid prototypes with excellent (sub-millimeter) detail. Current research points to the use of SLA (and additive manufacturing in general) as a fabrication alternative to traditional soft lithography for microfluidics. The layer-by-layer nature of modern 3D printing processes suggests a viable alternative to soft lithography, which is by comparison quite time-consuming and labor-intensive. But the process of using a liquid resin necessarily limits the materials compatible with SLA. Notably, there are very few printable electrically-conductive materials. </p>
	<p> My research project centers around the development of a conductive, 3D-printable multi-material resin that is compatible with commercial printers. The direct printing of so-called "multi-functional" devices using a composite material or a system of materials has been well explored using fused deposition modeling (FDM). However, SLA printing features dramatically improved resolution and surface finish quality, making it attractive for the field of microfluidics. As a simple demonstration of our printable conductive resin, a microfluidic capacitive pH sensor is in development.</p>

	<h3>3D-Printed Vertical Wind Turbine</h3>
	<p>As the final project of a lower-division engineering course, a (small-scale) wind turbine was designed, simulated (Solidworks FEA), 3D printed (FDM), and tested for structure stiffness and power generation. Subject to weight, height, and print volume restrictions, the tower structure was designed to minimize deflection in a bending mode with an applied horizontal load. The turbine blade geometry was also optimized to maximize the output power with a constant wind source. Our tower structure was inspired by the bamboo plant, a naturally stiff structure. The round cross-section contributes to a high moment of inertia, allowing the "beam" to withstand a bending moment. </p>
	<p> The turbine generated 1.25 watts of power in testing, and the structure had a stiffness of 3.8N/mm. </p>

	<h3>PET Squeeze Bottle Prototyping</h3>
	<p>I am working with a small business in the food industry looking to develop a PET squeeze bottle for one of their products. A critical part of the development process is to iterate over bottle geometries, including bend radii and neck sizes. Using FDM printing, I am able to fabricate test articles quickly, to provide physical prototypes of each bottle shape. This is a low-cost, fast way to determine the "feel" of each bottle, which informs any subsequent design choices. This simple application of 3D printing highlights the capability of the manufacturing technology to quickly produce high quality parts, and the easy turnaround between CAD model and physical specimen. </p>
