	<h3> Hello! </h3>
	<img id="me" src="me.jpeg"  height="300px" align="right"> <p> I'm currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Materials Science and Engineering. All my life, I have been fascinated by flight; growing up, I was always the kid that stopped walking to follow an airplane as it traced a path into the clouds. Due to several fantastic math and science teachers, my passion for plane-spotting grew into one for engineering - I've always had the dream of building something that could fly. I've been lucky enough to be a part of UC Berkeley's <a href="/seb.html">spaceshot rocketry team</a> throughout my time in college, which I can say with confidence has been the coolest thing I've ever done. The experience of building a composite airframe by hand for the first time drew me in immediately, and today my research interests lie in the intersection of 3D printing and composite materials. All this way, I've been guided by my love of flight - </p>
