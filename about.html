	<h3> Hello! </h3>
	<img src="me.jpeg"  height="225px" align="right" style="padding-left:30px;"> <p> I'm currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Materials Science and Engineering. All my life, I have been fascinated by flight; growing up, I was always the kid that stopped walking to follow an airplane as it traced a path into the clouds. Thanks to several fantastic math and science teachers, my passion for plane-spotting grew into one for engineering - I've always had the dream of designing and building something that could fly. I've been lucky enough realize that dream by being a part of UC Berkeley's <a href="/seb.html">spaceshot rocketry team</a> throughout my time in college, which I can say with confidence has been the coolest thing I've ever done. </p>

<p> The experience of building a composite airframe by hand for the first time immediately drew me in, and today my research interests lie in the intersection of 3D printing and composite materials. There is fascinating new research in both of these fields being published nearly every day, and I am excited to be here to witness it.  And all this way, I've been guided by my love of flight, of shooting for blue skies and bright stars. </p>
